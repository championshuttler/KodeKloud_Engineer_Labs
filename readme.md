# Kodekloud Engineer Labs 

This repository contains all my notes for Kodekloud Engineer tasks which are all performed in a live Linux environment. These tasks simulate actual enterprise challenges and mimics the day-to-day work of System Administrators and Devops Engineers.

For each task, a set of requirements are given. The documentations for the servers are also provided. It is up for the "engineer" to find the solution for each problem.
